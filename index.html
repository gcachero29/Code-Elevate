            <p class=" my-class">Usagi was introduced as a young teenage girl who doesn't do well in school. She meets a black cat luna who reveals that she is a magical human being that has a mission to find a power crystal and protect it from evil, and find a princess of the moon (which she finds out she is the princess). In my opinion, I feel like Usagi was such a relatable to people who are in her age group in real life which is why I like her character. Usagi is also presented as an air head in the  whole series which gives comic relief to heavy topics which are displayed in the plot.</p>

            <figcaption><strong> Mamoru/ Tuksedo Mask/ Usagi's love interest </strong></figcaption>
            <p>Mamoru is such a bland character. to make matters worse he always gets kidnapped or killed every other season and he's pretty much useless in fighting. His fighting style isn't even good, all he does is throw a pointy rose at his enemies and it barely makes a mark on someone who's attacking him. ALSO, this man is a whole adult dating Usagi who is barely 14 in the first season. Mamoru sucks and if he didn't exist I bet the plot of sailor moon would've been better </p>

            <figcaption><strong>Chibi Usa/ Sailor Chibi/ Sailor Moon's daughter</strong></figcaption>
            <p>Chibi Usa traveled back in time to her mom (Usagi) and basically started causing a whole course of problems the whole entire time. I will forever do Chibi Usa foul because she's such an annoying little kid who has magical powers. For one thing, when she traveled back in time she had a crush on her dad, which is really really weird. I guess at first she didn't know it was him because he looked so much younger but at the same time she should've known, Mamoru literally looks the same from her time line the only difference between his younger self and older self is that he has grey hair. Also. she literally almost killed the sailor scouts just because she made a deal with the evil side to become older and then she attacked them</p>
