            <figcaption><strong>Usagi Tuskino/ Sailor Moon/ the main character</strong></figcaption>
            <p class=" my-class">Usagi was introduced as a young teenage girl who doesn't do well in school. She meets a black cat luna who reveals that she is a magical human being that has a mission to find a power crystal and protect it from evil, and find a princess of the moon (which she finds out she is the princess). In my opinion, I feel like Usagi was such a relatable to people who are in her age group in real life which is why I like her character. Usagi is also presented as an air head in the  whole series which gives comic relief to heavy topics which are displayed in the plot.</p>

            <figcaption><strong> Mamoru/ Tuxsedo Mask/ Usagi's love interest </strong></figcaption>
            <p>Mamoru is such a bland character. to make matters worse he always gets kidnapped or killed every other season and he's pretty much useless in fighting. His fighting style isn't even good, all he does is throw a pointy rose at his enemies and it barely makes a mark on someone who's attacking him. ALSO, this man is a whole adult dating Usagi who is barely 14 in the first season. Mamoru sucks and if he didn't exist I bet the plot of sailor moon would've been better </p>

            <figcaption><strong>Chibi Usa/ Sailor Chibi/ Sailor Moon's daughter</strong></figcaption>
            <p>Chibi Usa traveled back in time to her mom (Usagi) and basically started causing a whole course of problems the whole entire time. I will forever do Chibi Usa foul because she's such an annoying little kid who has magical powers. For one thing, when she traveled back in time she had a crush on her dad, which is really really weird. I guess at first she didn't know it was him because he looked so much younger but at the same time she should've known, Mamoru literally looks the same from her time line the only difference between his younger self and older self is that he has grey hair. Also. she literally almost killed the sailor scouts just because she made a deal with the evil side to become older and then she attacked them</p>

            <figcaptiong><strong> Sailor Mars/ Rei Hino</strong></figcaptiong>
            <p> This girl is literally my favorite sailor scout. Her style outside of her sailor uniform is literally so immaculate. Rei out of one of the few scouts does not need a man to fight for her. Out of everyone in the group she's very compassionate about her relationship with the scouts, she's also very a quick thinker combat wise and i love her for that.</p>

            <figcaption><strong>Seiya/Usagi's love interest/Starlight Sailor</strong></figcaption>
            <p>Seiya is literally a 10/10 of a character. She's a jpop idol and goes undercover as boy, she's loyal with usagi and never leaves her side, and she's also a sailor scout for a whole different galaxy. I'm still mad to this day that she didn't end up with usagi because she was literally so understanding with Usagi when mamoru wasn't there (because he was kidnapped smh). Comparing him with mamoru seiya has better taste in fashion, the same age as usagi and isn't a grown adult, and she's just better than him. In conclusion: Seiya is the better choice. </p>
